# Report on Current Capabilities of the Software Support Agent System

## Overview

The *Software Support Agent System* is designed to assist with troubleshooting and resolving issues related to the Langflow repository. It analyzes support queries, extracts relevant error logs and system details, and identifies related files from the codebase. The system is built using *CrewAI, with **Gemini API* as the underlying LLM and *litellm* for handling completions.

### GitHub Code Fetching Methods:

1. *CrewAI’s Internal GitHub Tool* – Uses OpenAI’s API but is not utilized due to its dependency on OpenAI-specific tools.



## Current Capabilities

The system consists of one agent (*SoftwareSupportAgent*) and two primary tasks:

1. *Breaking Down the Support Query*
2. *Identifying Relevant Files from the Codebase*



---

### 1. Breaking Down the Support Query

*Description:*
This task extracts key components from the user’s support request, including error messages, system information, potential root causes, and troubleshooting steps.

*Expected Output:*
A structured JSON object with the following keys:

- *error\_messages* – Extracted error messages from the user query.
- *system\_info* – Relevant system details (OS, environment variables, dependencies, etc.).
- *possible\_causes* – A list of probable root causes for the reported issue.
- *troubleshooting\_steps* – Recommended steps to resolve the issue.

*Example Input:*


I am getting the following error when running Langflow:
"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'"
I installed all dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, but the error persists.
My system: Ubuntu 22.04, Python 3.10.


*Example Output:*

json
{
  "error_messages": ["ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain'"],
  "system_info": {"OS": "Ubuntu 22.04", "Python Version": "3.10"},
  "possible_causes": [
    "The 'langchain' module is missing or not installed.",
    "A virtual environment issue might be preventing dependency resolution."
  ],
  "troubleshooting_steps": [
    "Run pip show langchain to check if it's installed.",
    "Try pip install langchain.",
    "Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate."
  ]
}

### 2. Identifying Relevant Files from the Codebase

*Description:*
After breaking down the query, the system determines which code files are most relevant to each component of the issue (error messages, system information, possible causes, and troubleshooting steps).

*Expected Output:*
A JSON object mapping support components to relevant file paths.

*Example Input:*


(Same issue as before, with available file paths in Langflow repo)
{
  "paths": ["langflow/main.py", "langflow/utils/dependencies.py", "setup.py"]
}


*Example Output:*

json
{
  "error_messages_files": ["langflow/utils/dependencies.py"],
  "system_info_files": ["setup.py"],
  "possible_causes_files": ["langflow/main.py", "langflow/utils/dependencies.py"],
  "troubleshooting_steps_files": ["setup.py", "langflow/utils/dependencies.py"]
}


This output suggests that langflow/utils/dependencies.py likely handles missing dependencies, while setup.py contains installation instructions.

# Strengths of the Current System

✅ *Automated Troubleshooting* – Breaks down queries into structured formats.
✅ *Codebase Awareness* – Maps errors to relevant files in Langflow’s repository.
✅ *Task Modularity* – Ensures logical execution order (query breakdown → file selection → analysis).

This system enhances debugging efficiency, improves issue resolution, and provides structured, accurate responses to user queries regarding Langflow’s codebase.
